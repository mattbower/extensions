Responsive Images
=================

This extensions gives you a ``<pop:picture:responsive/>`` tag for adding responsive images to your site.

It uses [Picture fill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) to serve different sizes of images to different sizes of screen and pixel densities (e.g. Retina displays ) with only one server request per image.

Feel free to customize the picture fill markup being generated to suit your project.

Here's a little example of a responsive [Raptor Gallery](http://responsive-image.yourwebisonline.com/) that uses this extension.
